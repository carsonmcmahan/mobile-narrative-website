                        My Mobile Narrative Website is about the Los Angeles Dodgers and their stats
                        for
                        the last 50 years,
                        not including the 2022 season. I have always loved baseball from the time I could walk. I grew
                        up
                        going to Dodgers games and they have become my favorite team. I wanted to do my Mobile Narrative
                        Website on something that I enjoy and know quit a bit about. Baseball, and especially the
                        Dodgers,
                        is something that I am very passionate about. I would also say that I know more than the average
                        viewer but not as much as those die-hard fans. One specific question I would like to answer is
                        why I
                        did not include the 2022 season. I did not include it because I wanted data from all ready
                        completed
                        seasons. When going through each website I had found data for this assignment, the 2022 was not
                        complete like the other seasons. Therefore, I just decided it best to leave it out for my
                        website.
                    </p>
                    <p id="about-webpage">
                        My data was simple to collect. I found a website where it had stats on the Dodgers since they
                        were
                        founded as a team. While it was not the office MLB website, I felt that the data was accurate
                        and
                        could be used. I did however use the MLB website to find data on those players who had received
                        awards in the past 50 years. Lastly, I wanted to do something a little more fun than just straight
                        up
                        data on the team. I decided I wanted to find some information regarding the Dodgers rivalry with
                        the
                        San Francisco Giants. While it is not a lot of data, I believe it gets the point across.
                        Unfortunately, most of the data is in the Giants favor.
